# Blackjack-Game
Blackjack game played against the CPU


The Rules Are As Follows:
* There will be only 2 players – a “human” player and a dealer
* The players are each dealt 2 cards to start the hand
* The player can choose to hit one or more times, or stand with any amount
* The dealer must hit if his cards total less than 17 and stand otherwise
* If the player’s or dealer’s cards total over 21, they bust and their turn is over* If either player has 21 with their first two cards, they win (unless they both have 21 on their first two cards, in which case it is a tie)
* If both players bust, the dealer wins
* If both players have the same score, they tie
* The player always takes their turn before the dealer
* All cards count as their face value, except A which can be 1 or 11 and J, Q, K all count as 10
* The deck should be shuffled before each game
* You do not need to implement advanced blackjack rules (split, double or insurance)
* Only one deck will be used per game
